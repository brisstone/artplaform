The market price determined above will then form the current value of a unit of the artwork when traded in the secondary market. However, if the artwork is already traded in the secondary market, then the market price of the artwork becomes the last price at which a seller sold a unit of the artwork to a buyer. This value fluctuates relative to the forces of demand and supply in the secondary market and determines the total value of a user’s portfolio.",

This is through uploading your entire artwork for sale (which would be quantified as 100k units/splits) or alternatively uploading for sale a portion of the artwork (a minimum of 10% will be required or a sum of 10k units/splits).\n  These sales go directly to the primary market where bidders will procure splits and acquire split contract/s for the portions/ units/ splits owned by the buyer. \n  See more details below.\n  Note that the listing process, requirements, and related terms and conditions differ for each listing type. After a user submits a listing request, ARTSPLIT will verify ownership of the artwork via several world standard checks and balances, including but not limited to provenance checks.\n  However, ARTSPLIT will arrange for the pick-up of physical artwork. Logistics and processing fees paid by the user are non-refundable. If the request for listing is successful, a timed auction is created on the platform. A bid for ownership by other users or potential buyers commences.",
