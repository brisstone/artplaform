                                A wallet balance is the average amount of funds present in a wallet account of an

                                the average net amount after factoring in all deposits and withdrawals. A wallet
                                balance that falls below zero represents a net debtâ€”for example, when there is
                                an overdraft on the wallet. Such wallets account that has existing overdraft may
                                also reflect an amount owed.
